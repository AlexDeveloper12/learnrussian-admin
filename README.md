# Learn Russian Admin

The purpose of this application is to make it easier for myself to add/edit/delete phrases from and to the mobile app I developed and published onto the Google Play store. I went for a Material Design look with Roboto font. In the future I may add further functionality to it such as integration with my Dropbox account in addition to dark mode.

The user experience of doing this is much easier than entering values manually into a database table.

The project uses various packages such as React-Modal, Material-UI and and SweetAlert2.

Furthermore, I have used an ESLinter within this project and followed the React standards which has helped me improve my code quality and organisation.
